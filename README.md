R code (by Corey Bradshaw @ Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia — corey.bradshaw@flinders.edu.au) to analyse deterrent trials for devices used to reduce the incidence of white shark (<i>Carcharodon carcharias</i>) attacks

Includes files:

- 'white shark deterrent trials Github.R' (R code) - base generalised linear mixed-effects models and accompanying power analyses
- 'new_lmer_AIC_tables3.R' (R code) - functions to compare generalised linear mixed-effects models
- 'r.squared.R' (R code) - functions to estimate R2 for mixed-effects models
