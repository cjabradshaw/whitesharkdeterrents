R code (by Corey Bradshaw @ Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia â€” corey.bradshaw@flinders.edu.au) to analysis deterrent trials for devices used to reduce the incidence of white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) attacks

Includes files:

- 'white shark deterrent trials Github.R' (R code) - base generalised linear mixed-effects models and accompanying power analyses
- 'new_lmer_AIC_tables3.R' (R code) - functions to compare generalised linear mixed-effects models
- 'r.squared.R' (R code) - functions to estimate R2 for mixed-effects models
